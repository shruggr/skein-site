# skein-site

The management site of a [skein](https://github.com/shruggr/skein), as an
app (shruggr/skein#125): installed in a skein, it serves the page at
`/site/`, and at `/` when the owner adds that row (below). The files are
the same everywhere; what makes the page yours is the wallet in your
browser. A skein from the default image serves nothing until something is
installed: the host's own skein carries this app, installed by the host's
owner, and you manage your skeins from there, the page talking to each one
directly. Version **0.7.4** (shruggr/skein#92; the Inbox, #99; handles,
#103; profiles and search, #104; the wallet's grouped request, #97; an app,
#125; the signed claim, shruggr/skein#127).

## What it does

- **Connect a wallet.** Any BRC-100 wallet the browser reaches (Yours, or
  another, through `@1sat/connect` over `@bsv/sdk`'s `WalletClient`). Every
  request the page makes to a skein is signed by it on a BRC-104 session.
- **Your skeins (locators).** A locator is an output in your own wallet, in
  basket `skein-locators`: a PushDrop token (`@bsv/sdk`'s template, protocol
  `[1, "skein locator"]`, key id `1`, counterparty `self`) whose fields are
  the skein's identity key (33 bytes), its URL and a handle. The page lists
  the basket, and for each skein talks to that skein directly: the skein that
  served the page is never in the path. Anyone may keep a locator for any
  skein (a bookmark); what it resolves to is what your key may do there.
  Add one by URL (the identity is taken from the skein's signed answer);
  remove one (the wallet relinquishes the output).
- **Create a skein** (on a host skein, where the onboarding app is
  installed): your wallet signs the new skein's claim (skein's `signClaim`:
  a message naming no recipient, whose sender becomes the owner, #127), and
  `POST /onboard/call {fn: "onboard.create", args: {handle, claim}}` (as
  DAG-JSON) on your session; the answer `{handle, identity, url}`; the page writes a
  locator and opens the new skein's view here (a new skein serves no page:
  it is managed from this one).
- **A skein's page.** Its apps (the heads `<app>/app`), read from its
  explorer (`/explore`, a read the owner may make). **Install**: the
  catalog (`catalog.json`: our apps as a repository URL and a commit id) or
  any URL and commit id. The git app comes first, from the tree a skein of
  the default image carries (`apps/git`); then each install is one message
  to the git app's box, `{fn: "git.clone", args: {url, hash}}`, its answer
  `{tree, app}` read from the thread that message launched; the manifest is
  read out of the stored tree, the app record rebuilt in the page (skein's
  own install plan, `src/host/plan.ts`) and checked against the git app's,
  and the rows it asks for are shown resolved against this skein. On your
  approval the page sends the head, the dispatch rows and the start, signed
  by you. **Uninstall**: the stop, then its rows removed. **Address book**:
  entries added or removed by a `peers` message you approve.
- **Explorer**: the log, threads, a thread, any record (git trees
  browsable), what points at a record (edges), the dispatch table.
- **On a host skein**: the skeins created there (`onboard/instances/…`),
  each openable through a locator.
- **Your handles; register one** (on a skein a skein host runs). The page
  finds the host's router through `/.well-known/skein-host` (the router
  answers it at every skein's origin: `{origin, domain}`) and reads its
  BRC-169 manifest there (`metanet.trust.publicKey`, the certifier key;
  `metanet.handles.resolve`). **Register a handle**: your wallet signs
  `register <name>@<domain>` (the domain lower case; protocol
  `[2, "skein register"]`, key id the name,
  counterparty anyone); `POST <router>/account/register` creates your
  mailbox instance, `<name>@<domain>`, and answers with the BRC-52 handle
  certificate issued for your key (encrypted fields and a keyring for you);
  the wallet keeps it: `acquireCertificate` with `acquisitionProtocol:
  "direct"`, `keyringRevealer: "certifier"` (skipped when the wallet holds
  that serial number already). **Your handles**: `listCertificates` for that
  certifier and the BRC-169 handle type; each certificate checked (your key,
  its signature, the certifier the domain's manifest names), its fields
  decrypted with the keyring the wallet keeps (`@bsv/sdk`'s
  `MasterCertificate.decryptFields`), and resolved to its messagebox.
- **Your profile** (shruggr/skein#104). Each of your handles has a Profile
  form: a name and an avatar, an image inscription's outpoint (`txid_vout`
  or `txid.vout`). The page builds the OpNS profile record (`@1sat/utils`'
  `encodeProfile`: DAG-CBOR `{domain, name?, avatar?}`, the avatar as its 36
  bytes), your wallet signs it (`createSignature`, protocol
  `[1, "metanet handles profile"]`, key id `1`, counterparty anyone), and
  the page posts `{handle, record: <base64 of the bytes>, signature: <hex
  DER>}` to `POST <router>/account/profile`; the host's onboarding app keeps
  it and serves it in the handle's resolve answer (`profile`, with
  `displayName` and `avatarURL` derived for other clients).
- **Handles shown** (BRC-169 §2.4): the avatar, or an identicon drawn from
  the identity key, then `handle@domain`. A profile whose signature the page
  verifies against the handle's identity key (and whose domain is the
  handle's) is shown as signed by its key; the host's `displayName` and
  `avatarURL` are shown only without one, marked unattested.
- **Find a handle** (BRC-169 §5.6): the search endpoint the host's
  manifest names (`metanet.handles.search`), asked on an explicit Search
  (nothing is sent as you type; one query at a time), this page's host
  only. Results are hints; each result's profile is verified as above.
- **The Inbox** (`#/inbox`): a mailbox's box for your key — any BRC-33
  messagebox, such as your mailbox instance on a skein host. Give it the
  mailbox's URL and a box (default `metanet_inbox`); the page lists what is
  waiting there (`@bsv/message-box-client`'s `listMessagesLite`, on a
  BRC-104 session signed by your wallet). **Sync** runs `@1sat/actions`'
  `syncMetanetInbox` with the same wallet against that URL. It always reads
  `metanet_inbox` (the box field is for List only): each BRC-169 envelope
  there is opened (signature, decryption, content hash), its payment
  internalized into your wallet, then acknowledged. The page shows a row per
  message received (txid, sats, memo, sender) and a row per message left in
  the box with the SDK's reason, the SDK's `error` if it set one, and then
  lists the box again. The URL: the one you typed last (kept in this
  browser, `localStorage`, per identity key), else the messagebox your first
  handle resolves to (Your handles).

## The wallet's grouped request (`manifest.json`)

A BRC-100 wallet that seeks grouped permission (wallet-toolbox's
`WalletPermissionsManager`, `seekGroupedPermission`) reads
`<origin>/manifest.json` of the page's origin (shruggr/skein#97). The app
serves it at `/site/manifest.json`; at the origin's `/manifest.json` only
with the owner's root row (below), and a host's router may answer that path
itself. It asks once, under `metanet`, for:

- `groupPermissions`, granted together on the first call: the protocols
  `[1, "identity key retrieval"]`, `[2, "server hmac"]` (self), `[1, "skein
  locator"]`, `[2, "skein register"]` (anyone), `[1, "certificate
  acquisition <the BRC-169 handle type>"]`, `[1, "certificate list"]`,
  `[1, "metanet handles profile"]`; and the basket `skein-locators`. No
  spending allowance: a locator's spend (1 sat and its fee) is asked for
  when it happens.
  `[2, "auth message signature"]` is listed without a counterparty, which
  the toolbox leaves out of the first group: for a wallet without a
  counterparty prompt it is asked per skein instead.
- `counterpartyPermissions`, asked once per new counterparty (the first
  level-2 call to a key the wallet has no grant for): `auth message
  signature` (a BRC-104 session with that skein) and `certificate field
  encryption` (reading the handle certificates a host's certifier issued
  you). No counterparty keys are named: every skein and every certifier
  costs one first-contact prompt.

Not in it: the Inbox's calls. Sync decrypts each envelope under
`[2, "message encryption"]` with its sender as counterparty (any key) and
internalizes the payment with the label `metanet payment` (`[1, "action
label metanet payment"]`); a BRC-232 delivery brings its sender's labels
and baskets. The wallet asks for those as they come.

## The app

```
etc/app.json      the manifest (skein docs/APPS.md §2)
bin/site.wasm     the one program: a route handler (Zig, WASI preview1; src/main.zig), built by `zig build bin`
bin/site.json     its program record's description
www/              the page, served as it is in the tree
src/, build.zig, build.zig.zon, lib/, build.mjs, package.json   how bin/site.wasm and www/'s bundles are made
```

The program serves **the app's own tree**: on each request it reads the
head `site/app` (the app record the install wrote), takes its `tree`, and
answers with skein-sdk's `files.serve` (`lib/files.zig`: the file under the
row's `root`, a directory's `index.html`, a 301 for a directory named
without its `/`, the blob's CID as the ETag and 304 on `If-None-Match`, 404,
405). A read: it puts nothing and moves no head.

The manifest (description left out):

```json
{
  "kind": "app",
  "name": "site",
  "version": "0.7.4",
  "programs": { "site": "bin/site.wasm" },
  "provides": [{ "interface": "site/1", "functions": { "get": { "writes": false,
    "args": { "method?": "string", "route?": "string", "path?": "string", "query?": "string", "headers?": "map", "match?": "map" },
    "answer": { "status": "int", "type": "string", "headers": "map", "body": "bytes" } } } }],
  "requires": [],
  "dispatch": [
    { "transport": "http", "address": "/", "prefix": true, "sender": "*", "program": "site", "fn": "get", "root": "www" }
  ]
}
```

The row's address is relative to `/site/` (APPS.md §2: an app's http rows
are under its name), so the install asks for `http /site/* from anyone →
site.get (root www)`. The page's links are relative (`app.js`, `style.css`,
`catalog.json`), so it works under `/site/` and at `/`; the skein it was
served by is its URL less a trailing `/site`.

## Install

From the management page of a skein you own (Install, by URL and commit
id), or with skein's reference client as the owner:

```
skein plan install https://github.com/shruggr/skein-site#<the v0.7.4 commit> --origin <the skein's URL> --out plan
skein send <the skein's URL> plan
```

**The site at the root (optional).** An app's rows are under its name; the
root is the owner's. To serve the page at `/` too, the owner sends one more
row to the kernel's `dispatch` box, to the same program (the site's program
record, `programs.site` of the head `site/app`'s record):

```
{transport: "http", address: "/", prefix: true, sender: "*", program: <programs.site>, fn: "get", root: "www"}
```

With skein's client: `skein plan dispatch add --http --prefix --fn get
--settings '{"root":"www"}' / site.site --origin <url> --out root`, then
`skein send <url> root`. A prefix row at `/` is the instance's catch-all:
exact rows and longer prefixes (the messagebox, the explorer, every app's
`/<name>/…`) match first; any other path is the site's (a 404 when the
tree has no such file), and `/manifest.json` is the page's grouped request.
The row is the owner's, not the app's (no `app` field): an upgrade of the
site keeps it, and an uninstall leaves it (remove it with `skein plan
dispatch remove …` and the same arguments).

## Files

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `www/index.html`, `www/app.js`, `www/style.css` | the page: plain HTML and JavaScript, no framework |
| `www/catalog.json` | the apps the page offers |
| `www/manifest.json` | the wallet's grouped permission request (above) |
| `www/lib.js`, `www/chunk-*.js` | the libraries, one esbuild bundle (`lib/entry.ts`): skein's BRC-104 client (`src/client/raw.ts`), install plan and block encoder (`src/runtime/cid.ts`), `@1sat/connect`, `@bsv/sdk` (with its `Certificate`, `MasterCertificate` and `ProtoWallet`), `@bsv/message-box-client`, `@1sat/actions`' `syncMetanetInbox` (its module only), `@1sat/utils`' profile codec, `@1sat/templates`' outpoint bytes and `@1sat/types`' outpoint form (their modules only), `@ipld/dag-cbor`, `@ipld/dag-json` |
| `www/webwallet.js` | `@1sat/wallet-browser`'s `createWebWallet`, loaded only in test mode |
| `lib/entry.ts`, `lib/webwallet.ts`, `build.mjs`, `lib/SKEIN_REV` | how the bundles are made, and the skein commit they are made from |

Test mode: `?key=<private key hex>` runs a wallet in the tab over that key
instead of connecting one, and `&services=<url>` points it at a 1sat
services endpoint (skein's `kernel-zig/equiv/site.ts` drives the page this way).

## Build and test

The page's bundles (Node; the output is committed, the app serves `www/`
as it is in the tree):

```
npm ci
SKEIN_DIR=../skein node build.mjs     # a skein checkout at lib/SKEIN_REV, with its web/shims → www/lib.js, www/webwallet.js, www/chunk-*.js
```

The chunks' names hash the modules' paths, so the same bytes come out only
with the skein checkout at `../skein` as above.

The handler (Zig 0.16.0, `mise.toml`):

```
zig build          # zig-out/bin/site.wasm
zig build bin      # the same, into bin/site.wasm (committed; the build is reproducible)
zig build test     # the handler's checks (natively)
```

skein runs the app end to end: `kernel-zig/equiv/site.ts` (the page in
headless Chrome, installed in a host skein), `files.ts` (the handler's
answers) and `install.ts` (the install and uninstall), at a commit of this
repository pinned in skein's `src/testapps.ts`.

## Versions
